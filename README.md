### Individual Component Installation
```bash
./fonts/install.sh      # Install Nerd Fonts
./git/install.sh        # Git configuration and aliases
./node/install.sh       # Node.js via nodenv + global packages
./ruby/install.sh       # Ruby via rbenv + colorls gem
./shell/install.sh      # Oh My Zsh + Pure prompt
./apps/install.sh       # Desktop applications
./zsh/install.sh        # Zsh plugins and configuration
```

## Shell Features

### Aliases
- `lc`: Enhanced colorized directory listing
- `..`: Quick parent directory navigation

- **Docker**: Enhanced completion and aliases
- **Kubernetes**: kubectl plugins and completions

### Git Workflow
- Fast-forward only pulls for cleaner history
- SSH signing with GPG format
- Global gitignore patterns
- Automatic branch pruning

## System Requirements

- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu/Mint with apt package manager)
- **Shell**: zsh (will be configured automatically)
- **Terminal**: Warp recommended, tmux supported
- **Dependencies**: curl, git, build-essential (auto-installed)

## Architecture

### Modular Design
Each component is self-contained with its own installation script, making it easy to:
- Install only needed components
- Update individual parts
- Customize for different environments (desktop vs container)

### Safety Features
- All scripts check for existing installations
- Idempotent operations prevent conflicts
- Clear separation between system and user configurations

### Container Optimization
The `containers.sh` script provides a minimal installation suitable for Docker containers, excluding desktop-specific components like fonts and GUI applications.

## Customization

### Personal Configuration
Edit `git/.gitconfig.local` for your personal Git settings:
```bash
[user]
  name = Your Name
  email = your.email@example.com
```

### Additional Aliases
Add custom aliases to `shell/aliases.zsh` or create a local override file.

### Environment Variables
Extend `shell/exports.zsh` with project-specific environment variables.

## Maintenance

### Updates
- Run `omz update` periodically to update Oh My Zsh
- Re-run `./install.sh` to update language versions and packages
- Individual components can be updated with their specific install scripts

### Backup
Your original configuration files are typically backed up with `.old` extensions during installation.
